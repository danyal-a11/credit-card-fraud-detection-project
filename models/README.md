# Models Directory

This directory will contain trained machine learning models.

## Structure:
```
models/
├── baseline/          # Simple models (Logistic Regression)
├── ensemble/          # Random Forest, XGBoost
├── deep_learning/     # Neural Networks
└── README.md          # This file
```

## Models (Coming Soon):
- Logistic Regression (baseline)
- Random Forest
- XGBoost
- Neural Network

## Note:
Models larger than 100MB are excluded from Git. 
See model training notebooks to regenerate them.
